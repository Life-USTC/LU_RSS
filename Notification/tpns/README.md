# TPNS source code

TPNS's python source code is mainatained at (https://git.code.tencent.com/tpns/tpns-server-sdk/python), login required with tencent cloud account.

It's not regularly maintained and tencent git plafrom is just plain terrible, so it's NOT a submodule, and is not expected to be updated.
